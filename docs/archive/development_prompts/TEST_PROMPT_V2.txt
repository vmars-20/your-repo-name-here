Hi Claude! I'm testing the forge-vhdl-3v1-claude repository's cloud-first VHDL development experience.

This repo promises "Full VHDL simulation in your browser" with one-command setup. Let's validate the complete developer journey:

---

## Phase 1: First Impressions

Read these files and rate the clarity (1-10):
1. README.md - Does it convey "cloud-first" immediately?
2. QUICKSTART_CLOUD.md - Are steps clear for beginners?
3. llms.txt - Is cloud setup easy to find?

What works well? What's confusing?

---

## Phase 2: One-Command Setup

Run: `uv run python scripts/cloud_setup_with_ghdl.py`

Report:
- Did it work without errors?
- What was installed?
- How long did it take?
- Any warnings?

Expected: ~2-3 minutes, auto-installs GHDL

---

## Phase 3: Test Execution

```bash
# List tests
uv run python cocotb_tests/run.py --list

# Run tests
uv run python cocotb_tests/run.py forge_util_clk_divider
uv run python cocotb_tests/run.py forge_lut_pkg
```

Report:
- How many tests available?
- Did tests pass?
- Output lines per test (<20 expected)?
- Did GHDL actually simulate?

---

## Phase 4: AI Workflow

```bash
# Check agents exist
ls .claude/agents/
cat .claude/agents/README.md
```

Then try: `/gather-requirements`

Report: Are AI agents accessible and clear?

---

## Phase 5: Code Exploration

```bash
# Explore VHDL
find vhdl/components -name "*.vhd" | head -5
cat vhdl/components/utilities/forge_util_clk_divider.vhd

# Explore tests
ls cocotb_tests/components/forge_util_clk_divider_tests/
```

Report: Is code structure clear? Could you add a component?

---

## Phase 6: Progressive Testing

```bash
# P1 (fast, <20 lines)
uv run python cocotb_tests/run.py forge_util_clk_divider

# P2 (comprehensive)
TEST_LEVEL=P2_INTERMEDIATE uv run python cocotb_tests/run.py forge_util_clk_divider
```

Report: Output difference? Concept clear?

---

## Phase 7: Example Walkthrough

```bash
cd examples/counter
cat README.md
ls vhdl/ cocotb_tests/
```

Report: Does example demonstrate patterns clearly?

---

## Final Summary

Provide:
- ✅ What worked perfectly
- ⚠️ What could be improved
- ❌ What failed or blocked progress
- 💡 Recommendations
- 🎯 Overall rating (1-10)
- Would you recommend this to someone learning VHDL?

Thanks!
